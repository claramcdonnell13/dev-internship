			<h2>Instructions</h2>

			<p>Hi there! I'm glad you're interested in our developer internship here at New Kind. It wasn't <em>that</em> long ago that I was in your shoes, eager to break into the web-world.</p>

			<p>It's my goal for our intern to learn a ton of practical, real-world skills and knowledge, so that you're ready to step right into a developer role either here at New Kind, or wherever it is you'd like to go in the world.</p>

			<p>Let's start learning now! I'm going to need you to go fork this repo on github to submit your response. Don't know how to do that yet? That's ok! This industry is full of learning every day, and your ability and willingness to pick up new skills is paramount in what we're looking for. Get your hands dirty! <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Here's a good place to start</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>To submit:</strong> Just zip up a copy of your code and email it to <a href="mailto:tech@newkind.com">tech@newkind.com</a>, or publish it wherever you like and send us a link. Please feel free to be as creative as you'd like with what you submit. Don't feel constrained by the styles/layout that I've built here. This is a great time to show off your design and development sensibilities and skills! We'll be accepting submissions until January 15.</p>

			<h2>General Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>To be completely hontest, I am still a beginner at all things web development. I have become incredibly interested in web design in the last 6 months, and have been learning all that I can, through online tutorials and Coursera classes. I have experience with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, as well as some basic familiarity with responsive design and frameworks like Bootstrap. With this internship, I am hoping to gain real-world knowledge and practical skills to aid me on my journey in pursuing a career in web design. </li>
				<li>I am hoping to focus on the design side of web development, and would be interested in learning more about responsive design. </li>
				<li>I am by nature a very independent worker. I enjoy learning things on my own and taking on challenges. I believe that I would both enjoy the independence of this position, and thrive in meeting the challenges that such a position presents. </li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Design Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Design is not about appearance. Design is about the entire experience of using a site. This does include appearance, but it also includes vastly important things like functionality, usability, and the overall user experience. I believe that designers and developers should work closely together in developing how a site functions overall, and how usability plays into the design. </li>
				<li>Grids are useful for creating a guide for how to present content in an organized, uniform manner. They design based on proportionality, which can be beneficial when creating for a variety of platforms. I begin a project with a grid system, using it to organize content from the beginning of a project.</li>
				<li>Pattern libraries include standards and code for different elements of design, such as buttons or nav bars. These libraries can be useful for standardization across a variety of products and can add ease to the design process.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Technical Questions</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>I have not developed any plug ins or additions to WordPress, but am familiar with general use and creation of WordPress sites.</li>
				<li>This is my first time using version control.</li>
				<li>I have experienece only with CSS3</li>
				<li>I have done a bit of work with Bootstrap, but have not done any mobile development. </li>
				<li>I follow more design based blogs, such as 52 weeks of UX and HOW Design. I listen to podcasts like The Creative Coding Podcast, and Giant Thinkers. I am always looking for suggestions! </li>
				<li>As mentioned previously, I have mostly focused on the design side up until this point, so I have worked exclusively with design tools, such as Adobe Creative Suite and Sketch, and have used text editors and CodePen for all development work.</li>
				<li>HTML provides all the content on the web page. CSS is responsible for all styling of the page, and JavaScript adds interactivity and additional functionality of the page.</li>
				<li>Graceful degradation. It is easy to add and add, but the hard and valuable part is choosing the crucial elements and simplifying.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>What else?</h2>

			<p>I fully recognize that I am a beginner, and am very new to the field. However, I have become dedicated to learning web development, and am truly self-motivated to continue to learn. I have a great deal to learn, but I am a fast learner and and incredibly hard worker! I strive to meet every challenge presented to me, and will work as hard as possible to succeed in my work. I am not an obvious choice for this position, but I can guarantee that I will not be a disappointment.</p>
